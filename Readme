# WordPress Deployment with Ansible 🚀

Welcome to the WordPress Deployment with Ansible project! 🎉 This setup automates the provisioning of EC2 instances, installation of WordPress, MySQL configuration, and lifecycle management for EC2 instances.

No manual configurations, no headaches—just pure automation magic! ✨

## Project Highlights

* **Fully Automated EC2 Provisioning**
    * Creates an EC2 instance (type t3.small) with Ubuntu 22.04. 🌐
    * Automatically prints the instance's public IP as a clickable WordPress URL. 🔗

* **WordPress Installation**
    * Installs WordPress with all necessary configurations. 🖥️
    * Configures Apache and PHP extensions for optimal performance. 📜

* **MySQL 8 with Automatic Backups**
    * Installs MySQL 8, sets up the WordPress database, and schedules a daily cron job to back up all databases. 🕒

* **EC2 Lifecycle Management**
    * Includes tasks to start, stop, or delete EC2 instances, all triggered via tags or roles. 🔄

## Why Choose This Setup?

* **Time-Saving:** Fully automated, reducing deployment time to minutes. ⏳
* **Scalable:** Modular roles work on any infrastructure. 🛠️
* **Secure:** Includes automated backups and sensitive data protection. 🔐
* **Effortless:** Easily manage EC2 instances with lifecycle commands. 🖱️

## Prerequisites

Install Ansible and required collections:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ansible -y
ansible-galaxy collection install amazon.aws
```

Set up AWS CLI credentials:

```bash
aws configure
```

## Usage

**To provision an EC2 instance, set up WordPress, and configure MySQL:**

```bash
ansible-playbook wordpress.yml -e "@override_vars.yml"
```

**To manage EC2 instances:**

* Stop an instance:

```bash
ansible-playbook wordpress.yml --tags stop
```

* Start an instance:

```bash
ansible-playbook wordpress.yml --tags start
```

* Delete an instance:

```bash
ansible-playbook wordpress.yml --tags delete
```

## Acceptance Test

* The playbook provisions an EC2 instance and prints its public WordPress URL.
* MySQL and WordPress roles can run independently on any machine.
* EC2 lifecycle actions (start, stop, delete) work seamlessly.

## Security

Sensitive data like AWS credentials is excluded. Use Ansible Vault or environment variables to securely manage secrets.
