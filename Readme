## 🚦 **Getting Started**

### 🔧 **Prerequisites**

1. Install **Ansible**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install ansible -y
   ```
2. Install the AWS Ansible collection:
   ```bash
   ansible-galaxy collection install amazon.aws
   ```
3. Configure your AWS credentials using the AWS CLI:
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

---

### 📜 **How to Use**

1. **Run the Full Playbook**: 🖥️
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook wordpress.yml -e "@override_vars.yml"
   ```
   This provisions an EC2 instance, sets up WordPress, and configures MySQL.

2. **Manage EC2 Lifecycle**: 🔄
   - Stop the instance:
     ```bash
     ansible-playbook wordpress.yml --tags stop
     ```
   - Start the instance:
     ```bash
     ansible-playbook wordpress.yml --tags start
     ```
   - Delete the instance:
     ```bash
     ansible-playbook wordpress.yml --tags delete
     ```

---

## 🎯 **Acceptance Test**

1. ✅ **EC2 Role** provisions an instance and prints a working WordPress URL.
2. ✅ **MySQL Role** and **WordPress Role** are modular—can run independently on different machines.
3. ✅ **Lifecycle Management** operates via tags or dedicated roles.
